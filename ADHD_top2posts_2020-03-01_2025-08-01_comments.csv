I also want to ask, if your son is still fairly young--has he ever been evaluated for autism? I have both ADHD and autism (they overlap super often) and his tendency to hyper fixate, focus on patterns, and occasionally have issues picking up on social norms all read as autism to me more than ADHD. Not saying he doesn't have both--about half of people with autism do!--but it would be good to know because it has some key differences from ADHD, one major one being that ADHD is generally very treatable with medicine while autism isn't. Obviously I'm just someone online who's never met your son, so of course defer to what his doctors actually say, but it took me a long time to get the ""aha!"" of understanding why I wasn't quite matching up with just ADHD symptoms and could start understanding myself better and forgiving myself when I struggled.

He had eye surgery at 8 weeks old, wears a contact lens and patches his eye 4hrs a day. He is 2 now. Not the easiest life- but if I had never caught it, it would‚Äôve been too late to save the vision in his eye. Who knows when it would‚Äôve been caught.

I know this is not my place. But..
Not to self diagnose a stranger over the Internet, but have you considered that ur son might have AuDHD? (ADHD with autism)
He sounds exactly like me as a kid, noone noticed my autism, i only got diagnosed when I turned 23 (and only cuz i accidentally watched a tiktok about it and recognised myself in it). And the impulsive directness, super observant of details, hyper fixation on patterns or differences, his other diagnosis. All very typical for AuDHD, and also *exactly* like me as a kid.

I could be wrong, cuz I dont know your son. But I'd recommend you look into it, maybe read about it.

There are some conditions which can cause an eye to NOT have a normal red reflection, so it could be a warning sign of a problem if one eye‚Äôs light reflex is different from the other. Other color reflexes that might show up in either one or both eyes are white, yellow or black. Cataract and retinoblastoma are a couple of conditions that might present themselves with a white reflex, also known as leukocoria. Should you happen to notice this, please consult with your eye doctor and if necessary, a pediatric ophthalmologist.

1hf8k5t,m2het33,None,2024-12-17 04:14:44,"My only story about a funeral has to do with me as a child.

Around 12 years old, 7th ish grade, my cousin passed from terminal brain cancer. She has the exact same oncologist my daughter had for treatment. Needless to say, when he brought up my cousin, by name, and how much of a hero she is because of all of the experimental chemotherapy and radiation treatments she did, I was in shock and disbelief. This oncologist has been at this hospital for literally nearly 40 years!!!!!! Turns out, they literally microwaved (100% radiation, same amount as adults in 1989) her brain. Genetically my dad's side carries the neurofibromatosis gene. They did not understand in 1989 that the fibromas were not malignant. They thought every eye or brain tumor was cancerous, no matter what. To this day, I can smell my cousin. When my daughter was going through chemo, she had the ""cancer/chemo"" smell. Ask anyone who's either had cancer or is with a loved one when they are undergoing treatment. It's a very foul pungently disgusting smell. I might vomit just thinking of it ... Let's just say when I found out she had the exact same oncologist is the day I bumped up from Xanax to Klonopin, and I haven't gone back. I have never been diagnosed autistic, I have a chronic PTSD diagnosis as well as ADHD, insomnia and generalized anxiety with panic attacks that last longer than 30 minute diagnosis. But I do have trigger smells. If multiple senses are not triggered, or I'm forced to think of an abstract thought, my brain will not do it. I've always considered myself ""weird"" or ""different"".



Anyways- When she passed, she had a dog. I am an avid animal lover. I have always been, I was vegetarian for over a decade (and I'm not even 35 yet) I trauma-bonded with this dog. The weeks it took for my uncle to get the funeral together, this dog was literally at my house. At her funeral my uncle (my dead cousin's dad) asked if I would walk the dog into the funeral with our family. Little ole me, being tall, but only about 105 lbs, I took on the task like it was my last. WORST MISTAKE EVER. This dog literally BOUNDED INTO THE MOTHERF*CKING CASKET.  Nearly knocked cousin out of her final resting place, and I missed nearly all of her funeral sobbing because I thought I had destroyed my cousins funeral (my mom kind of told me I did, too. The nasty b*tch).

I approach him bold as brass, reach for his hands and since he knew I was his boss's daughter he was all ready to do the obligatory ""hello small child have a hug Merry Christmas"" but instead I grab his hands and demand he tell me how he got so burned and does his skin hurt!?

My mother is MORTIFIED and probably ready to wring my neck and beg this kind man's forgiveness but he rears his head back and just *laughs* from the depths of his soul, scoops me up and tells me in his melodic accent that he was born with his beautiful black skin and isn't it amazing that humans come in a variety of shapes and colors and how boring would it be if we were all just pale white and covered in lace. He roasted a 5 year old like a frickin' pro. 

That man was such an amazing human. He saved me from a throttling AND taught my impulsively inappropriate child butt that maybe demanding answers to impertinent questions wasn't a good strategy.

Claiming that ADHD is a superpower, offers positives/gifts, or is only harmful because of ""society"" is dangerous and demoralizing. 
It erases the experiences of most people with ADHD and ignores scientific evidence. 

**Please don't do it.**

There's no credible scientific evidence to suggest that ADHD imparts any definitively positive abilities or traits, and the negative consequences of framing ADHD as some kind of giftedness or special ability far outweigh any benefits.

Claiming that ADHD is a superpower, offers positives/gifts, or is only harmful because of ""society"" is dangerous and demoralizing. 
It erases the experiences of most people with ADHD and ignores scientific evidence.

There's no credible scientific evidence to suggest that ADHD imparts any definitively positive abilities or traits, and the negative consequences of framing ADHD as some kind of giftedness or special ability far outweigh any benefits.

I worry so much about a cancer reoccurrence. As far as retinoblastoma goes I think we are safe, I just worry it spread to somewhere we never found. She struggles in school with handwriting, and get this, her school never informed her gym teacher of her disability. I told him over half way through her kindergarten year. He was shocked!!!!!! He couldn't believe how good she is at throwing and catching things considering her monocular vision. I'm hoping to get her involved in some sort of shooting/archery sport. Either that or she could be a brute on the defensive line in football (she's a tall and strong girl! 60ish lbs and 4'3""! She is the size of most 7-8 year olds! I was the same!) Her oncologist was amazing about telling me how much of a normal life she will lead, and that it may seem so detrimental but she adjusted amazingly. She was already completely blind in that eye when she was diagnosed. Zero vision at all.

Do you have issues when you're sick? Or do you have a prosthetic eye? My daughter has a hand painted glass eye. It gets super snotty and full of eye boogers when she's sick, so I take it out at home. Just this last week, she's had a cold. When I took it out I could see the relief on her face.

1hf8k5t,m2c8w0w,psqqa,2024-12-16 07:24:58,"ADHD and autism are so closely related and there‚Äôs a lot of cross-symptoming that happens. This is really obvious in my family where we all either have adhd or are on the spectrum. I am very obviously my adhd father‚Äôs adhd daughter (and my grandmother, although obviously never diagnosed, was very obviously his adhd mother), but I have my on the spectrum somewhere mother‚Äôs tendency towards touch aversion. 

My sister has been diagnosed by different doctors as being either on the spectrum, adhd, bipolar, depressed, etc. Adhd is the one she feels is most right for her.

When I first met with the psychiatrist who diagnosed me (at the age of 21, because being a quiet daydreamer whose grades vacillated wildly but were for the most part very good just made me the perfect student to my pre-university teachers who batted away any concerns my mother might have had) and told her my suspicions I had adhd, she told me upfront she wouldn‚Äôt be able to diagnose me with adhd until she‚Äôd met with me for a while because I very obviously had an anxiety disorder and without more information and knowing me better it would be nearly impossible to  distinguish any possible adhd from anxiety symptoms.

Anyway, lost track of my point somewhere along the way there, but basically I think you and your son‚Äôs doctors are right to focus on specific issues rather than specific diagnoses. Ultimately, the point of all that is to get people the help they need. If you, your son, and your son‚Äôs team are able to identify where he‚Äôs struggling, figure out a likely cause, and from there work out a functional solution, I think there‚Äôs no need to worry about the finer details.

And it sounds like both you and your son‚Äôs doctors are alive to the various possibilities and keeping an eye out for them, so I think he‚Äôs in good hands. You‚Äôre doing a great job. I‚Äôm your age and I can‚Äôt imagine having been through what you‚Äôve been through and raising two kids through all of it. I barely get myself to eat real food on any given day, let alone keep two other people alive and well. I‚Äôm really proud of all the work you‚Äôve done and are doing, and I‚Äôm happy your life and family has the results to show for it (your kids are alive! they‚Äôre safe! they trust you! they‚Äôre happy! they have people looking out for them!)

Re: SSRIs and other meds. I‚Äôve had good luck with medication, but my sister is super sensitive to meds and has hated most meds she‚Äôs been on. My father isn‚Äôt a huge fan of his meds either, although he does mostly take them. 

Neither my mother, my sister, nor I tolerate hormonal birth control in any kind of way. I also have significant PMS issues. I was on escitalopram for about a decade for basic anxiety, then switched to sertraline a few years ago to see if that would help with the PMS issues more as well. It‚Äôs made a huge difference.

What I‚Äôm leading into with this is that I could see the hormonal bullshit of puberty being somewhat rougher on your son. Obviously (I am making an assumption here that your son is cisgender) the menstrual cycle isn‚Äôt there and I don‚Äôt know to what degree similar hormonal bullshit might occur in people who don‚Äôt menstruate, but there‚Äôs so much fuckery going on with hormones that it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. And it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it‚Äôs a tough journey to sort out what medication, or other form of treatment, might be the best solution for it.

I‚Äôm sure it was terrifying to hear your son talk like that, but the fact that he told you the dark feelings he was having and that you immediately listened and acted on it is such a fantastic sign, and it gives me faith that, even if it is tough, you‚Äôll be able to figure it out and keep him safe while you do.

As for your daughter, what a blessing. What a beautiful moment in difficult circumstances. I read a post somewhere about two strangers going through difficulties meeting and one of them saying to the other ‚Äúthis too will have its place‚Äù. A wonderful way to think about it imo, and I think one that can be applied to this moment. Whether that focus on detail comes from his adhd or a trauma response, it served a function here (the same one evolution presumably intended it to serve). I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger‚Äù is a particularly useful or helpful or frankly true message, but I think there can be value in taking a sort of‚Ä¶functional view of life‚Äôs ups and downs. Something good *can* come from something bad. Not necessarily, and not in any sort of predestined or moral reward kind of way, but simply because experience builds on experience, and in the innumerable paths that intersect over the course of a lifetime, there is always a place for experience.

Give your kids, and most importantly *yourself* a hug for me. You guys are going to be just fine <3

Or how about when I was asked about the abuse I suffered  at my mother's hands? When asked for a rough timeline, I was unable to give an exact date, but I was able to provide the season/ rough month of various incidents, a rough time of day, and explained her actions in detail.

While I have ADHD and it does affect my memory, certain things stand out. If an event happens and people forget the day it happened or what else happened say leading up to or during it, I can remember. 

Hell, even as a writer/ avid reader and artist, detail is a huge thing. It adds realisim, in the case of writing, it helps paint a picture so people can invision what you're writing.   There's tells, foreshadowing, hints if you will about how events will unfold. Throw away lines/ actions suddenly have a greater impact when events or actions cone to pass.

Ever watch Reacher? The mantra ""details matter"" plays a huge part in the series. Things people overlook, don't notice, don't see the significance of until it's pointed out, or even see even though it's right there staring them in the face.

You can be a good observer AND have great attention 
 to detail when you have ADHD. Again there's exceptions to every rule, so while many folks with ADHD may struggle with details, others may be great with the same details. 

Slightly unrelated, but you do realize that people  can figure out workarounds and ways to compensate  for somethings right? Like deficiencies, some disabilities (mainly learning) or developmental challenges. We can learn to cope, come up with neat tricks, figure out ways to help us understand. 

The brain is a shifty bastard that decides what it will and will not learn and it's up to us to figure out how to get around that or to work with what we've got. 

Sure, on a good day, I'm lucky IF I remembered  to eat or what I ate for breakfast. But remembering weird obscure facts and applying them to a situation when it arises which helps others or yourself? Snapping into action or finding a precarious and stressful situation and just acting/ righting or taking control of the situation even without understanding how you did it? Go ahead and explain that. 

Call it what you will, you can't  deny that we're wired differently and that we can function in unexpected but amazingly cool ways.",2,t1_m2fuqis,False,/r/ADHD/comments/1hf8k5t/my_sons_adhd_saved_his_sisters_life/m2g64j8/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hf8k5t/my_sons_adhd_saved_his_sisters_life/m2g64j8/,t3_1hf8k5t

pelip6,hayiex5,chickentenders222,2021-08-30 11:21:40,"Dr.Russel A Barkley, makes a very great point when he says that teaching skills in ADHD is basically useless without pharmacological treatment, and even then it should be more on building behavioral interventions rather that skills, but both are still heavily dependent upon the efficiency of pharmacological treatment. 

A planner doesn't help when you

\-forget it 

\-forget to write in it 

\-lose it

\-Attempt to write something in it, and then get distracted and forgot what you were going to write or totally forgot what you we're doing 

\-don't have a writing utensil 

\-Forget to check the planner when you finally do write things in it 

The list goes on, a planner can help, but it's very dependent on other factors if it's going to benefit at all. Also it only helps with like a very small fraction of ADHD symptomology, you then have the list of problems that occur when your actually reminder by the planner to do something, then you have all the problems that come with, ya know... actually doing it. Like beginning it, not getting distracted, finishing it in time, not making careless mistakes, oh what if the planner reminds you when you're in the middle of something and you're giving that dilemma of droping one thing and potentially forgetting the other.

pelip6,hby860j,outintheyard,2021-09-07 09:49:15,"I have a clipboard. As notepaper, I stock it with the blank backside of mis-printed pages and the like that would otherwise be in the recycle bin. I jot everything down as I go about my day: calls I make (incl. who I spoke to and the result), plans I make, upcoming appts, things I need to do or buy and corresponding lists of what will help me accomplish those things. 

I jot these things in my own format. There are no lines on the paper so I just have each group of things in a separate corner so they aren't limited in size but are not jumbled together. At the end of the day I go over my page to see if everything is still relevant. If not, I draw a line through it. If everything on the page is voided, I throw the page away. If most of it is still useful, I transfer it to the back of the stack. If there is only a small area that I will need in the future, I rewrite that part on the next page and expand on it if need be the following day. 

I can therefore go to the back of my clipboard pages and literally see what I did each day because unless the whole page was deemed ""finished"", it should still be back there in chronological order.

Last, but important detail: I always use pencil so I can make it neater, move things to a different category etc... Not just any pencil though. I use a Pentel 7 or 9 (lead size), mechanical pencil. It fits perfectly under the clip so it's always right there on my clipboard, they have replacement erasers and the extra lead can be stored in astonishing amounts in the barrel of the pencil.

... No. You keep your little ""happy planners"" that you're so proud of, you have a routine where you even check all your social media without a fault in the same order every day and then you sit on your ass, do none of the chores because you ""don't feel like it"" and play mobile games instead, in which you meticulously do all the side quests and tasks. Then you go to the store, at the same hour every day to buy all your things without needing a list because you just remember. And you're capable of focusing on a task you have to do and just do it. And you've already proven many times that you never experience sensory overload and dont even understand it. Infact according to you it's not even real and i'm just unapproachable and aggressive.

 At least for me a planner is good in theory but it needs more mechanics to aid me in remembering to even look at the planner. I need things like alarms and other reminders.

  Also if I begin to rely on the planner EVERYTHING needs to go in or I will end up missing dates that I forgot to enter. This adds a whole new layer of responsibility and anxiety for me because if I am in a busy/mobile environment and need to write something down or am on the move walking through doorways I am very lucky if I don't get distracted by something or someone before it gets into the right spot in the planner.

When I started talking to a few friends about it, their innocent reaction was: ""oh yeah I think I might have it too, dont we all have a little ADHD?"" and ""isn't it just that you don't set out proper goals?"" the last one followed by a bunch of advice as ""stay motivated, push yourself more"" etc.

Although I know they mean good, it felt extremely frustrating, because in one hand they are reducing the struggles of my ADHD to ""problem focusing at college"" and ""lazy, unmotivated"" and on the other hand they think I'm making a big deal about it because of the idea that we are all a little distracted sometimes.

I tried to explain in depth about emotional desregulation and long term consecuenses of untreated adhd like the extreme social/generalized anxiety and impostor syndrome, and how I been trying so hard to be functional for as long as I can remember. But at the end I got an ""don't be so bummed out about life, you have great qualities! You are exaggerating your problems"" and ended up looking like a neurotic.

After that I decided to keep it to myself specially with my neurotypical friends. My boyfriend also tries to disqualify my suspicion since I told him. Even my psychologist isn't too sure about adhd being persistent in adulthood as she told me is probable that I had it AS A CHILD, but isn't sure I could still have it (even though I have all of the symptoms and they express in every aspect of my life but whatever.....).

That said, my paper calendar is an amazing tool for me. I love that ugly thing! I have a pencil on a string so I can immediately write down important tasks. I do check marks and stars  to mark completed tasks off and I love seeing my accomplishments checked off and stars for special things. If something doesn't get done I erase and move it. I never use pen or cross things off cause that hits the failure button in my brain.

My calendar is just plain pages I printed from the internet. It's on a stick on cork board shape next to my bed. I put a bunch of shaped pieces up and it actually looks hideous now with all the crap pinned on the shapes, the calendar, posts it's everywhere, occasionally checks I don't feel like taking a simple pic of for the deposit app, mail, pencil on a string, etc but I don't care. I probably won't miss jury duty again because my juror badge is in my face every day.

pelip6,hb2dvuc,TamaBunny87,2021-08-31 08:11:55,"Someone gave me this exact advice once and it changed my life.

I got a planner, and I put in all my important dates.

2 weeks later I was making some roast potatoes when I remembered that I promised my partner a romantic meal out, and should really make sure I picked a date that didn't clash with any events I have on this week. I recalled that the planner existed and would be perfect for this, but I didn't have a pen so I went into the living room to get one. I had a few that weren't working at all, feel a bit silly putting them back in the drawer so I took out the drawer and decided to test out the pens and chuck out the ones that weren't working. But I needed some scrap paper to test out the pens so I went to my other junk drawer to find a notebook.

Luckily there was one on top, but it wasn't a notebook, it was a planner! Underneath it was 12 other planners that I had bought all the other times someone had given me that advice! Imagine that!

Anyway, I felt a bit silly leaving all those planners in the drawer when I clearly wasn't going to use them (I have a new planner that I was *definitely* going to use) so I decided to just chuck them all out, start afresh. When I took them into the kitchen I realised the bin was way too full and needed to be taken out. I felt a bit silly that I'd left the bin to get this full without taking it out. So I tied up the bag and took it out front.

I felt pretty good about myself until the smoke alarm went off - I'd been heating up oil in the oven for roast potatoes. I felt pretty silly because I'd let all my potatoes get eyes having left them in the cupboard for way too long, as I often do. I managed to turn the smoke alarm off and air out the kitchen but I didn't have any clean teatowels or oven gloves to take the hot tray out of the oven. I felt a bit silly not having any clean teatowels so I decided to put some laundry on.

When I got to the washing machine I realised there was already a load of clean laundry in there that needed to be washed again as it was a bit musty. I decided to put it on again for another rinse to freshen it up. That's when I realised I was really hungry and thirsty. I felt pretty silly having not eaten or drank all day so I decided to go back into the kitchen to finish those potatoes and...

It's scary like that, I feel easily overwhelmed with simple tasks and break down, it can get dangerous and I have to have my partner help me when I am like that... work collegues have asked if I am ok when I am like this, as it becomes like I am mentally disabled by it.

I noticed that today, after the mess my mind was in and unable to process anything, I just had one or two more cups of strong coffee and I felt alot better... not 100% but enough to not end up crying and feeling overwhelmed and anxious... I'll probebly have to do this at work too if I come across another day like this, which I do, but normal coffee doesn't seem to work so well.

The past few days my mind has been really busy, overwhelming, like on speed, which it normally is, I managed to be productive instead of being too irritable thankfully though... well mood swings still... but then for some reason after all that it's like my brain burns out and exits the building for the next few days after and my mind is quieter, usually end up unable to do anything, cook or look after myself too well, end up messing things up at work and can't drive or function as a normal person, but for so many years I've not thought strong coffee would have a good effect on me for days like this... so I'm going to keep doing that when I need it, see if it keeps on working until I go for my assesment.

Coffee can be as bad though, it can make me anxious too, so apart from menally better, I can have panic attacks having too much so it's not the best option.

pelip6,hb0kjio,surrogateuterus,2021-08-30 20:37:10,"So here's what I did... And it really only works sometimes. 

I got addicted to playing with my phone. And whenever I have a task or appt or anything I'm supposed to do, I put it in my phone's cloud calendar.... immediately. 

If I don't do the immediately, I forget. If I think I'll remember to do it later, I'll forget. 

Every phone number I ever dial to a live person gets added to my contacts. 

If I visually need to remember something, I take a picture of it. 

Also all apps that have this kind of importance to helping me achieve anything gets put on the home screen. 

Oh! And there's alerts!

But I can't do daily reminder alerts, like for medicine because I get annoyed, bored, used to it and then it becomes ineffective. I *haven't* figured that one out yet. 

But I was halfway through my 20s or so before smart phones were actually a generally useful thing and until then, I fucked up a lot. And it wasn't until about 10 years into having a smartphone that I realized if I can immediately put it in the phone, it will save my ass about 55% of the time. 

That's all I got. Still working on finding a solution to the rest though. Like forgetting the words or conversation midway through. Or how to deal with randomly changing tasks in the middle of a task with no outside stimulus causing it. Motivation is bonkers too. But I figured out a helper for task management.

Just because you can does not mean everyone can. People with ADHD have a critical lack of neurotransmitter hormones in their brain. Doing the dishes becomes a monumental task.

Keeping a planner is impossible if you keep forgetting it, doing exercise is just as impossible if you cannot find the energy to motivate yourself.

Some people can without medical help and good for them, personally I can't nor can countless other adhd sufferers.

What you're showing is a servere lack of understanding on how the condition effects others differently and how other conditions are also just as crippling. Go try telling someone without legs to go walk without prosthetics and see what response you get.

I also, use it for different purposes, so I will try to divide it below, and what works for me might not work for you.

## Clearing my head

There is a TODO-list technique called ""Get things done"" or GTD for short. There is a lot of information about this and even a book. But the technique is really simple so if you want to learn more about it try to find a simple blogpost about it - it isn't rocket science.

Anyway, step 1 of the technique is to capture everything that has your attention (which for people like us is a lot) this could be things like: notes, things I want to do, things I want to look up, things I might want to do etc etc. I have a project called ""For later"" which is just a mess of tasks and thoughts that I might never do (point if GTD is that you don't aim to do everything). But getting stuff out of my head and into Asana helps me clear my head of thoughts and I can focus better.

## Getting stuff done.

The way I function is that if something is in Asana and planned to be done I will do it eventually. And if something is not in Asana I probably will never do it, forget it or whatever. So I plan everything.

\- Work  
\- Universty  
\- Personal (things like brush teeth, do laundry, pay bills, go out with trash, clean etc etc. basic shit that neurotypical people don't even need to plan that they just do)  


So to clarify what I put in Asana as task are.  


\- EVERYTHING that I feel like I need to do.  
\- EVERYTHING that I've failed to do, so I don't fail at it next time (like oh I forgot to book time for haircut - Into asana repeat task every 3rd month).  
\- EVERYTHING I dream about doing.  
\- EVERYTHING that's on my mind in general  
\- EVERYTHING that I think I might want to do or look up in the future.

## Connect to goals and priority, dates, and recurrent.

I have one Project called ""Life goals"" where I have all my life goals.

Then I have 3 projects called ""Low priority"", ""Medium priority"" and ""High priority"". When I create new tasks in let's say the Project ""Universy"" I also check them towards the goals I have and based on that and how time sensitive they are also try to cross set them to one of the priority projects.

I have a task that recurrs monthly that tells me to plan the upcoming month. This for me means to go over tasks and give them a duedate during the upcoming month (if they don't already have one) and also assigned myself to the task. Also reccurent tasks are the best like ""Go out with trash"" Repeat every second day, or ""Book time for haircut"" repeat ever 3rd month.

Then daily I go into ""My tasks"" and start working on the tasks that are set for the day, I use filters in this view to first only work on the tasks who are in the Project ""High Priority"", then I go on the medium ones etc.

# Pen and Paper

When I am doing focus work for long hours (School, University, Work, etc) I can't use Asana, I don't know why but it interrupts my flow somehow.

So what I did for many years was to use pen and paper (don't know why, but I've always liked pen and paper better than digital notes, I just mess them up some how).So at the start of the day I took the tasks out of asana related to example the days Universy work and put them on a paper. Then while doing this work, all new todos, notes etc I would put down on the paper, and then at the end of the day I would put them in Asana. And repeat this process the next day.

However, I usually had issues keeping track of my paper notes, if something was in asana already, if I had forgotten it, if it was on multiple pages I usually forgot the tasks on one page and so on. And I often found notes from years back that I never did but it didn't matter anymore because they were now obsolete xD

So years later (I think 1 year ago) I bought a reMarkable tablet. It's tablet with e-ink that is supposed to have the same function as paper and pen, but digital (send the notes to your PC, copy notes between pages etc). And this one works really well with the workflow that I've setup (better than paper and pen did). But it's a bit expensive so it took a while until I got it. But if you are the kind who loves pen and paper when you are ""in the work mode"" I can really recommend this one the day you feel you have the money for it (because as I understood you are still in school so this device might feel a bit expensive for its simple purpose).

You have inspired me to rewrite The book of Genesis... And I would like it in a narrated twice, one would be as Morgan Freeman and the other would be Anthony Mendes (in the same tone that he uses in Jane the Virgin)


Before creation...
""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters"" (Genesis 1:1-2)

[I'll do the short version]

in the beginning - God started creation
the first day - light was created
the second day - the sky was created
the third day - dry land, seas, plants and trees were created
the fourth day - the Sun, Moon and stars were created
the fifth day - creatures that live in the sea and creatures that fly were created
the sixth day - animals that live on the land and finally humans, made in the image of God were created
by day seven - God finished his work of creation and rested, making the seventh day a special holy day, except those without planners

pelip6,hb2no7q,UnicornBestFriend,2021-08-31 09:17:53,"Word. One thing I wish got mentioned more is that BuJo has a learning curve, esp. if you struggle with organization and benefit from both structure and freedom. Each person really has to figure out what they need and what works. On my second BuJo, I jettisoned the OG migration system - the backbone! - bc it required so much effort it became overwhelming.

The simpler and easier the setup, the lower the barrier of entry.

Also, the BuJo can function as part of a larger organization system. 

Sharing my system in case it inspires:

My primary need is keeping track of appointments and events at-a-glance. My only BuJo setup is drawing two year's worth of monthly calendar spreads. This takes me about an hour. If I have ample pages after two years, I will add more months.

I use a dot grid Leuchtturm 1917 bc it comes w an index and numbered pages. The size is big enough for a calendar month spread over two pages. 

I use my BuJo to keep track of my appointments, lists, and other random info. My current one has a sticker chart for my reading goals, which I added a few months in.

I free-write into a mead 5star to dump my brain onto the page, sort out my thoughts, and get them into the appropriate buckets (e.g. movie list on my Google Keep). 

I use the separate Productivity Planner to structure my day and list out daily tasks.

Both BuJo and PP stay open on my desk all day.

* I took a bunch of the stickers I've saved and never used (thanks decision paralysis) and affixed them to the notebook. This made the notebook look really cool on the outside.
* I bought a nifty mutli-pen (Uni Jetstream) that I always attach to the notebook.
* I let myself doodle on every page.
* I use highlighters to identify pages that I use for stuff other than the regular journal. 
* I tell my coworkers that if I don't write down their request in my notebook, it's not gonna happen. Essentially, I've outsourced reminders to use it and keep it handy. 

All these things make the journal snazzy and shiny enough to keep my attention. That said, I need to get some new pen colors; the red/black/blue/green options of the mutli-pen are boring me. Plus I grew up (39yo) without ubiquitous computers and cloud sync, which I think has made the physical act of writing help my memory. 

I also had to make a few concessions to the ""official"" approach:

* I only use it for work; that way, I can keep it with my work stuff. I'd definitely misplace it if I took it away from my work stuff.
* Each two-page spread is for one week. That way, I can see the entire week at once. I usually try 
* I don't do the future log, index, or monthly pages. I know I won't use and monthly pages. Anything that might fit in a future log page instead goes in the computer (OneNote) so I can search and scan easily and anywhere.

Then at the beginning of each month I'll make a monthly calendar where I can fill in events for easy reference. The rest is pretty much just me writing down my daily goals. 

I've added some stuff over time too. I started doing a monthly mood tracker last month when I began making major changes to my meds. And now I do a weekly goals list so I'm not just coming up with random stuff to do every day. 

I also use my bullet journal for general note-taking, and I create categories in the table of contents for various subjects. It's actually been really great for me for the past year and a half.

pelip6,hazmwau,helanthius_anomalus,2021-08-30 16:08:55,"Responding to you and to /u/Fairwhetherfriend (just want to say, I do agree that handwritten isn't for everyone, but physically writing something does actually engage a different part of your brain and make you more likely to remember it, there's statistically significant findings indicating this. However, we should base what we do on what is FUNCTIONAL and PRACTICAL, not necessarily what has the best outcome for neurotypical people).

When I started journaling, I was still in college and used planners with pre-made layouts. I found I got super bored with them and would eventually hate them. The joy of bullet journaling is that you can change it up to fit whatever you need it to be. Right now, I have a semi-standard layout I use for each week that uses 4 pages, has all 7 days, sleep tracker, cat medicine tracker, weather forecast, calendar, and task list all available at a glance by using a dutch window. I then decorate with washi tape and stickers to make it engaging to my brain.

When I first started, I went to the subreddit and looked up spreads on pinterest and got super into trying to find the perfect layout and doing really pretty spreads with lots of artwork and trying to use other people's bullet symbol systems. I failed miserably because it was too much on days when my mental health was bad. This is the other edge of the sword with a system with this much freedom: you need to figure out what works for you. For someone like /u/Fairwhetherfriend, a digital bullet journal system probably would work loads better, especially if they have a phone with a stylus (which gets you the benefit of writing AND the benefit of digital) or if they use a notebook designed to be scanned into a digital system like Evernote ([How To ADHD on Youtube talks about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE)) or the [Rocket journal.](https://getrocketbook.com/)

However, like you said, it's hard to figure out where to start with ""finding what works for you"", right? Start with the video from the creator of the bullet journal method [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM). His system was WAY too simple for me, I would get bored so fast and never do it. That's why I had to add stickers, washi tape, doodles, etc. Maybe you're like me and will enjoy that part of it! Maybe you're like my friend who also has ADHD and the idea of having to create layouts every week gives you anxiety. You may need to experiment to discover what works best for your brain.

&#x200B;

My modified symbol system looks like this:

A single dot bullet (.) denotes a task.

A single dash bullet (-) denotes a note.

A single circle bullet (o) denotes an event.

When I migrate a task forward to another day or week, I use the forward carrot or greater than sign (>).

When I migrate a task onto my future log, I use the backward carrot or less than sign (<).

When I cancel a task or event, I strike it out (~~as so~~).

When I reschedule an event, I draw a little arrow from the circle to the right. (->)

When I complete a task, I cross it out with an X, if I don't complete it but made progress on it, I use a single slash (\\) across the dot.

When I complete an event (such as a doctors appointment or meeting) I use a plain check mark inside the circle).

Then I have 3 symbols I use to call attention to specific things: \* for importance, ! for inspiration, and $ for financial/money/expenses/budget. I will also sometimes use a red cross to mark doctors appointments on my monthly calendar.

And that's it. I made a key on a bit of watercolor paper that I tape in the front of each new bujo in case I forget what my system was.

&#x200B;

And if something isn't working for me, I stop doing it. For a while, the future log was super overwhelming to me, so I didn't bother. I had just a 2 page monthly spread (left page has the days down the middle with the date, vertically, with events on the left side and expenses on the right; the right page has my habit tracker with all the days vertical and a monthly notes/task list), and my 4 page weekly spread and then any random collections I thought of (like lists of books I want to read or lists of plants native to my state, etc.) I also fell behind on using the index. Recently, as my depression started to lift a bit, I started using a future log again and filled out my index with the page numbers for everything I'd done so far.

&#x200B;

Every bullet journal I have looks different (I've completed about 6 now). I change up how I have my spreads, sometimes week to week, sometimes every couple months, and I always have random pages interspersed for things that catch my interest. Sometimes it's super beautiful and worthy of posting on the subreddits (if I did that sort of thing) and other times it's literally just a list using the most basic layout possible. Sometimes it's a basic layout with next to nothing written on each day. Sometimes I don't make the layout until Monday, or Tuesday, or Friday.

But whenever I do use it, it helps. And when my brain betrays me and I can't remember if I've given my partner their weekly medicated shot, the bujo is my source of truth I can rely on to tell me which side we did last week and whether we have done it this week. I am better able to keep track of my bills (mostly) and my meetings and I find that if I start my day, right after meds, with filling things out in the bujo, I'm able to keep things sorted and it really helps my executive function. I don't strive for a perfect system, I strive for a functional system and I encourage you to do the same! Just be warned, it can take a while to figure that out. My ADHD-artistic brain WANTS to do super intricate painted or drawn layouts with title pages for each month and mood trackers and fancy dutch doors and folded pages. But that's not FUNCTIONAL or PRACTICAL for the days I'm not at all creative and just need to be able to supplement the weak areas of my brain, so instead I find washi tape and stickers that I love and use that instead to make it pretty and engaging. You can even get tape and/or stickers with things like the days of the week so you don't have to write the day or month stickers or To Do stickers, all kinds of stuff.

&#x200B;

Ugh, I'm sorry. I wrote a novel. For your convenience, **TL;DR would be: come up with a basic bullet symbol system then experiment with layouts until you find the balance between detailed/pretty/fun enough to engage your brain and practical/functional enough that you'll actually use it.** And if pen and paper isn't something that works for you, use a digital system instead!

pelip6,hb1jyuf,ayshasmysha,2021-08-31 04:03:58,"Mine just helps to structure my day. If I want to keep track of x, y, z then I can add that in. 

At the beginning of my journal I have the year outlook. I just divided 4 pages into 3 (one section for each month) and put in birthdays, appts etc.

At the beginning of each month I put aside two pages but really you only need one. On the left page I have the the days running down. I refer back to the year outlook and note down relevant appts etc. The right page I use to track things like when I went gym, when I cleaned etc. 

Then I have my weekly which is a two page spread divided into 8. This is a more detailed overview of what I need to do that week and it ties in with my dailies (dailys?). It would be nice if I did it on Sundays but it often gets done on Mondays or Tuesdays. I refer to the monthly to see if there are any things pre scheduled. 

My daily set up includes a list of things I need to do which I make up using my weeklies. I also make note of what time I took my meds and what I've eaten (I undereat and it's good to know at the end of the day if I have). I cross off the things I got through and then 'migrate' the things I haven't to another day. I also turn back to the weekly to migrate that task too. 

I tried to make this sound uncomplicated but I'm pretty sure I didn't accomplish that. What it helps me to do is remember to do things for work or at home. It's helpful because it's all in one place. I would often forget to do Thing A because I put it on a post it note and put that somewhere in my lab book. But now Thing A gets put down in the bullet journal and because I'm referring back to the weekly/monthly/yearly it doesn't get forgotten. It also helps to show which things I constantly put off. That helps me figure out what help I need to do them. I'm new to ADHDing (diagnosed last year at 33) and looking through I can see which days I fucked up, which days were good. What was a good month and what was a bad month. Why were they like that? Did I overplan?

Also, I love making lists but I lose or forget these lists but no longer as my lists go here. Because there's an index page I can make the list and make note on what page it's on at the beginning.

r/Basicbulletjournals will help. It doesn't need to be pretty. Just functional for you.

I guess that's where the book comes in but it seems like there should be a free overview.

Your system sounds a lot like how I used my planner when I was in college, I would write tasks across the day roughly when they should happen, then checkmarks were done, crossed off wasn't done and would be rescheduled (""migrated""). Helped me see over time how much stuff I could actually fit in a day how much was checked vs crossed.

Unfortunately as soon as I wasn't in school and constant taking notebooks in and out of my bag, any paper planner would just end up lost, squished, and unused at the bottom of a bag.

pelip6,hazhvhn,None,2021-08-30 15:31:00,"Honestly I find explaining ADHD to be more annoying, because having a bad spine is a lot more simple. I just need to.

1. Try to stay thin because more weight strains my spine

2. Exercise but not go too hard to keep my back in line.

3. Possibly get surgery (I was on the borderline but chose not to)

Even if I hear dumb advise from people I either know it doesn't work, or I'm already doing it and it won't do what they claim. With ADHD I get a way more diverse amount of advise, and people never really deny that my spine is straight, they just tell me that I'm not in pain which feels different to me.

Also one benefit is I don't think imposter syndrome is possible when I can look in a mirror and see a very uneven ribcage/body. 

The pain isn't great, but I can fairly easily just try to ignore it in a way that I can't so much with ADHD because I don't do these things on purpose, and I'm only ever in too much pain to function if I injure myself or I'm over exerted for long periods of time.

pelip6,hb549w2,None,2021-08-31 19:58:36,"Yeah, I do ok. I don't think I'm fully into ""need to see a doctor"" territory but I have spent decades honing a variety of coping mechanisms. They mostly work. My brother was diagnosed as a kid but it was the 70s and things were different then (I'm 10 years younger). I learned a lot from him (lists, calendar, do it and it's done, etc).

Edit - I meant to say that I come here to learn about the emotional aspects of this. I've lived my whole life not understanding why certain things were harder for me or things other other don't mind irritate the hell out of me. It's been a real learing experience.",1,t1_hb4xk1a,False,/r/ADHD/comments/pelip6/how_i_cured_my_adhd_permanently/hb549w2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pelip6/how_i_cured_my_adhd_permanently/hb549w2/,t3_pelip6

My top curve was 39 and my bottom was 41. My doctor took one look at it and said,""She's going to get surgery for this"" 

Don't let that scare you away, but if you're going to get it, just be prepared that the recovery time was about a year. I still did things past 5 or 6 months but it was restricted.
