1hf8k5t,My son's ADHD saved his sister's life,None,15214,2024-12-15 18:05:27,417,"My son was only 7 years old when he took a picture of his little sister on his new tablet. He noticed something. One eye was red, one eye was white? He has always hyper fixated on patterns, or differences in things. This has had its ups and downs. He will ask larger people why they are fat (at 5.5 years old- sorry nurse at the ER at some hospital in Flint, MI) or point out someone's physical disability. He means well, he is just fascinated and curious. He has an IEP at school and has a ""combined"" ADHD diagnosis, a ""learning disability"" and ""other trauma and stressor related"" disorder.

My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma ( rare form of pediatric eye cancer) because of this picture, alone. She had her 3 year well child visit less than 2 months prior to her diagnosis.

She had an enucleation, and having told the surgeon and eye specialist the story of why she was diagnosed, she said to tell my 7 year old son he saved his little sister's life. She was in tears when she told me the tumor was a mere 1-2 mm ( THATS MILLIMETERS Y'ALL) from spreading to her brain via her optic nerve. 6 rounds of chemo and she has made one heck of a recovery. She did lose her hair, her right eye and she does struggle in school a bit. Chemo has some nasty side effects, even years down the road from treatment. She doesn't remember having two eyes. As sad as it is, it's worked in her favor.

She is now 6 years old, and in 1st grade. Her brother still has his little sister, and he is my super hero, forever!!  

EDIT/ADDED AFTER- Wow I am so shocked by the attention this has gotten. YES my son absolutely saved his little sister. I have never once said it was his ADHD that saved her. Honestly, it was just a catchy title. Thank you so much for your kind words, and concern that my son may have been misdiagnosed. I promise you all, he is very loved, and no one on this earth cares more about his health and well being. That being said, I don't think him having any other diagnosis would result in any difference in his treatment plan. He has multiple Drs who reassure me that I am taking all of the correct steps, and that additional testing is not necessary, as of right now. I will continue to advocate for all of my children, and I hope this made your day when you read it :) thanks again.

pelip6,How I cured my adhd permanently,VitaminNutrient,12808,2021-08-30 09:25:28,884,"I've been suffering from adhd my whole life, for about 26 years now. And when I was at work a very close friend of mine told me something that cured my adhd, I have no symptoms since then. All he said was one sentence, and I mean it when I tell you this saved my life:

""Just use a planner""

I was shocked when he said this, and my adhd went away as soon as he finished that sentence. I started focusing like crazy. Guys try this out.

If you didn't notice this is satire, but I'm tired of hearing that shit over and over again, I'm at the point where I make fun of it because of how bad the advice is.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pelip6/how_i_cured_my_adhd_permanently/,True,False
